==========

Tess-two library and a tess app finally setup in gradle 1.10 android studio 0.4.6 (if it matters).android sdk 19

Tess-two was working correctly on eclipse but android studio is causing some errors. It looks like a known error. 
Please see if you guys can replicate and find a solution :

/the error is in TessBaseAPI class System.loadlibrary();java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: Couldn't load lept from loader....
